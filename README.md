## Scenario
With the current speed of new innovations in the data space, building modular, loosely coupled, and programmatically adaptable solutions for our tech stack is essential to move fast and deliver value to our stakeholders.
 
In this case, our AI startup has gotten some sales, some revenue, and some publicity = traction.  This has led to you getting an investor, with some tech background.  Our investor is insisting that a new, more scalable, tech-stack be deployed as a condition for the 2nd tranche of her investment into our firm.
